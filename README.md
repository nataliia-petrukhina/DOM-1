# The Guessing Game
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


Here you can practice adding JavaScript to a webpage, as well as working with the browser's `window` object by creating a simple game.

## Task

Create a game which generates a random integer between 1 and 10. The user has 3 chances to guess the number. If they don't guess the number in 3 tries, they fail the game.

- Using the `<script>` tag, link the external JavaScript file [index.js](/index.js) with the [index.html](/index.html) file
- Write your JavaScript in the [index.js](/index.js) file
- Meet the requirements outlined below

## Requirements

- Use the **window** `alert` and `prompt` functions to display and capture information

- Create a function named `randomNumber` which;

  - takes in no arguments
  - returns a random integer between **1** and **10**

- Create a function named `guessingGame` which;

  - takes in no arguments
  - doesn't return anything
  - calls `randomNumber` to get a random number
  - keeps track of the amount of guesses with another variable
  - `prompt` the user to guess a number
  - if the user is incorrect, `prompt` a new guess until they tried 3 times
  - if the user is correct, `alert` a congratulation
  - if the user guessed incorrectly 3 times, tell them the correct number with an `alert`

- Call `guessingGame()` to initialize the application
